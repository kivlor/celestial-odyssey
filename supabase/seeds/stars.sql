!cover

a full-stack typescript monorepo starter with shared types, using bun, hono, vite, and react

why bhvr?

while there are plenty of existing app building stacks out there, many of them are either bloated, outdated, or have too much of a vendor lock-in. bhvr is built with the opinion that you should be able to deploy your client or server in any environment while also keeping type saftey.

features
full-stack typescript: end-to-end type safety between client and server
shared types: common type definitions shared between client and server
monorepo structure: organized as a workspaces-based monorepo
modern stack:
bun as the javascript runtime
hono as the backend framework
vite for frontend bundling
react for the frontend ui

project structure

server

bhvr uses hono as a backend api for it''s simplicity and massive ecosystem of plugins. if you have ever used express then it might feel familiar. declaring routes and returning data is easy.

if you wanted to add a database to hono you can do so with a multitude of typescript libraries like supabase, or orms like drizzle or prisma

client

bhvr uses vite + react typescript template, which means you can build your frontend just as you would with any other react app. this makes it flexible to add ui components like shadcn/ui or routing using react router.

shared

the shared package is used for anything you want to share between the server and client. this could be types or libraries that you use in both the enviorments.

inside the src/index.ts we export any of our code from the folders so it''s usabe in other parts of the monorepo

by running bun run dev or bun run build it will compile and export the packages from shared so it can be used in either client or server

getting started

quick start

you can start a new bhvr project using the cli

installation

development

building

deployment

deplying each piece is very versatile and can be done numerous ways, and exploration into automating these will happen at a later date. here are some references in the meantime.

client
orbiter
github pages
netlify
cloudflare pages

server**
cloudflare worker
bun
node.js

type sharing

types are automatically shared between the client and server thanks to the shared package and typescript path aliases. you can import them in your code using:

let ai build multi-agent workflows for you in minutes

quickstart  docs  discord  website  youtube
start from an idea -> copilot builds your multi-agent workflows
e.g. "build me an assistant for a food delivery company to handle delivery status and missing items. include the necessary tools."
connect mcp servers
add the mcp servers in settings -> import the tools into rowboat.
integrate into your app using the http api or python sdk
grab the project id and generated api key from settings and use the api.

powered by openai''s agents sdk, rowboat is the fastest way to build multi-agents!

quick start
set your openai key
clone the repository and start rowboat docker
access the app at http://localhost:3000.

note: see the using custom llm providers section of our docs for using custom providers like openrouter and litellm.

sps his a next‑generation, rust‑powered package manager inspired by homebrew. it installs and manages:
formulae: command‑line tools, libraries, and languages
casks: desktop applications and related artifacts on macos

> arm only for now, might add x86 support eventually

---

️ project structure
sps‑core core library: fetching, dependency resolution, archive extraction, artifact handling (apps, binaries, pkg installers, fonts, plugins, zap/preflight/uninstall stanzas, etc.)
sps‑cli command‑line interface: sps executable wrapping the core library.

---

current status
bottle installation and uninstallation
cask installation and uninstallation
reinstall command for reinstalls
upgrade command for updates (very careful. i ran into no system breakers, my perl install got nuked though)
parallel downloads and installs for speed
automatic dependency resolution and installation
building formulae from source (very early impl)

---

roadmap
cleanup old downloads, versions, caches
prefix isolation: support /opt/sps as standalone layout
sps init helper to bootstrap your environment
ongoing bug fixes and stability improvements

---

trying it out:

> due too the amount of work keeping the crates up to date with every change would entail the crates.io published version will only be updated after major changes or fixes (if there are none expect once a week)
---

---

usage

-----

️ building from source

prerequisites: rust toolchain (stable).

the sps binary will be at target/release/sps. add it to your path.

-----

using the latest nightly build

you can download the latest nightly build from actions/workflows/rust.yml inside this repository (select a successful build and scroll down to artifacts).

before running the downloaded binary, remove the quarantine attribute:

then, you can run the binary directly:

-----

contributing

sps lives and grows by your feedback and code\! we’re particularly looking for:
testing and bug reports for cask & bottle installation + --build-from-source
test coverage for core and cask modules
cli ui/ux improvements
see contributing.md

feel free to open issues or prs. every contribution helps\!
