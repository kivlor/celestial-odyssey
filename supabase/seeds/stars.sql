If you have ever used Express then it might feel familiar. Declaring routes and returning data is easy.\n\n```\nserver\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bun.lock\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src\n‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tsconfig.json\n```\n\n```typescript src/index.ts\nimport { Hono } from \'hono\'\nimport { cors } from \'hono/cors\'\nimport type { ApiResponse } from \'shared/dist\'\n\nconst app = new Hono()\n\napp.use(cors())\n\napp.get(\'/\', (c) => {\n  return c.text(\'Hello Hono!\')\n})\n\napp.get(\'/hello\', async (c) => {\n\n  const data: ApiResponse = {\n    message: "Hello BHVR!",\n    success: true\n  }\n\n  return c.json(data, { status: 200 })\n})\n\nexport default app\n```\n\nIf you wanted to add a database to Hono you can do so with a multitude of Typescript libraries like [Supabase](https://supabase.com), or ORMs like [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/get-started) or [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/orm)\n\n### Client\n\nbhvr uses Vite + React Typescript template, which means you can build your frontend just as you would with any other React app. This makes it flexible to add UI components like [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) or routing using [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/start/declarative/installation).\n\n```\nclient\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ eslint.config.js\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public\n‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ vite.svg\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src\n‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.css\n‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.tsx\n‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets\n‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.css\n‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.tsx\n‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ vite-env.d.ts\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tsconfig.app.json\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tsconfig.json\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tsconfig.node.json\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ vite.config.ts\n```\n\n```typescript src/App.tsx\nimport { useState } from \'react\'\nimport beaver from \'./assets/beaver.svg\'\nimport { ApiResponse } from \'shared\'\nimport \'./App.css\'\n\nconst SERVER_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_SERVER_URL || "http://localhost:3000"\n\nfunction App() {\n  const [data, setData] = useState<ApiResponse | undefined>()\n\n  async function sendRequest() {\n    try {\n      const req = await fetch(`${SERVER_URL}/hello`)\n      const res: ApiResponse = await req.json()\n      setData(res)\n    } catch (error) {\n      console.log(error)\n    }\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <div>\n        <a href="https://github.com/stevedylandev/bhvr" target="_blank">\n          <img src={beaver} className="logo" alt="beaver logo" />\n        </a>\n      </div>\n      <h1>bhvr</h1>\n      <h2>Bun + Hono + Vite + React</h2>\n      <p>A typesafe fullstack monorepo</p>\n      <div className="card">\n        <button onClick={sendRequest}>\n          Call API\n        </button>\n        {data && (\n          <pre className=\'response\'>\n            <code>\n            Message: {data.message} <br />\n            Success: {data.success.toString()}\n            </code>\n          </pre>\n        )}\n      </div>\n      <p className="read-the-docs">\n        Click the beaver to learn more\n      </p>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default App\n```\n\n### Shared\n\nThe Shared package is used for anything you want to share between the Server and Client. This could be types or libraries that you use in both the enviorments.\n\n```\nshared\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src\n‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts\n‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ types\n‚îÇ¬†¬†     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tsconfig.json\n```\n\nInside the `src/index.ts` we export any of our code from the folders so it\'s usabe in other parts of the monorepo\n\n```typescript\nexport * from "./types"\n```\n\nBy running `bun run dev` or `bun run build` it will compile and export the packages from `shared` so it can be used in either `client` or `server`\n\n```typescript\nimport { ApiResponse } from \'shared\'\n```\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Quick Start\n\nYou can start a new bhvr project using the [CLI](https://github.com/stevedylandev/create-bhvr)\n\n```bash\nbun create bhvr\n```\n\n### Installation\n\n```bash\n# Install dependencies for all workspaces\nbun install\n```\n\n### Development\n\n```bash\n# Run shared types in watch mode, server, and client all at once\nbun run dev\n\n# Or run individual parts\nbun run dev:shared  # Watch and compile shared types\nbun run dev:server  # Run the Hono backend\nbun run dev:client  # Run the Vite dev server for React\n```\n\n### Building\n\n```bash\n# Build everything\nbun run build\n\n# Or build individual parts\nbun run build:shared  # Build the shared types package\nbun run build:client  # Build the React frontend\n```\n\n### Deployment\n\nDeplying each piece is very versatile and can be done numerous ways, and exploration into automating these will happen at a later date. Here are some references in the meantime.\n\n**Client**\n- [Orbiter](https://orbiter.host)\n- [GitHub Pages](https://vite.dev/guide/static-deploy.html#github-pages)\n- [Netlify](https://vite.dev/guide/static-deploy.html#netlify)\n- [Cloudflare Pages](https://vite.dev/guide/static-deploy.html#cloudflare-pages)\n\n**Server**\n- [Cloudflare Worker](https://gist.github.com/stevedylandev/4aa1fc569bcba46b7169193c0498d0b3)\n- [Bun](https://hono.dev/docs/getting-started/bun)\n- [Node.js](https://hono.dev/docs/getting-started/nodejs)\n\n## Type Sharing\n\nTypes are automatically shared between the client and server thanks to the shared package and TypeScript path aliases.

"Build me an assistant for a food delivery company to handle delivery status and missing items. Include the necessary tools."\n- üåê **Connect MCP servers**\n   - Add the MCP servers in settings -> import the tools into Rowboat.     \n- üìû **Integrate into your app using the HTTP API or Python SDK**\n   - Grab the project ID and generated API key from settings and use the API.\n\nPowered by OpenAI\'s Agents SDK, Rowboat is the fastest way to build multi-agents!\n\n## Quick start\n1. Set your OpenAI key\n      ```bash\n   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key\n   ```\n      \n2. Clone the repository and start Rowboat docker\n   ```bash\n   git clone git@github.com:rowboatlabs/rowboat.git\n   cd rowboat\n   docker-compose up --build\n   ```\n\n3. Access the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).\n\nNote: See the [Using custom LLM providers](https://docs.rowboatlabs.com/setup/#using-custom-llm-providers) section of our docs for using custom providers like OpenRouter and LiteLLM.\n\n## Demo\n\n#### Create a multi-agent assistant with MCP tools by chatting with Rowboat\n[![Screenshot 2025-04-23 at 00 25 31](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8a41622-8e0e-459f-becb-767503489866)](https://youtu.be/YRTCw9UHRbU)\n\n## Integrate with Rowboat agents\n\nThere are 2 ways to integrate with the agents you create in Rowboat\n\n1. HTTP API\n   - You can use the API directly at [http://localhost:3000/api/v1/](http://localhost:3000/api/v1/)\n   - See [API Docs](https://docs.rowboatlabs.com/using_the_api/) for details\n   ```bash\n   curl --location \'http://localhost:3000/api/v1/<PROJECT_ID>/chat\' \\\n   --header \'Content-Type: application/json\' \\\n   --header \'Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>\' \\\n   --data \'{\n       "messages": [\n           {\n               "role": "user",\n               "content": "tell me the weather in london in metric units"\n           }\n       ],\n       "state": null\n   }\'\n   ```\n   \n\n2. Python SDK\n   You can use the included Python SDK to interact with the Agents\n   ```\n   pip install rowboat\n   ```\n\n   See [SDK Docs](https://docs.rowboatlabs.com/using_the_sdk/) for details. Here is a quick example:\n   ```python\n   from rowboat import Client, StatefulChat\n   from rowboat.schema import UserMessage, SystemMessage\n\n   # Initialize the client\n   client = Client(\n       host="http://localhost:3000",\n       project_id="<PROJECT_ID>",\n       api_key="<API_KEY>"\n   )\n\n   # Create a stateful chat session (recommended)\n   chat = StatefulChat(client)\n   response = chat.run("What\'s the weather in London?")\n   print(response)\n\n   # Or use the low-level client API\n   messages = [\n       SystemMessage(role=\'system\', content="You are a helpful assistant"),\n       UserMessage(role=\'user\', content="Hello, how are you?")\n   ]\n   \n   # Get response\n   response = client.chat(messages=messages)\n   print(response.messages[-1].content)\n   ```\n\n\nRefer to [Docs](https://docs.rowboatlabs.com/) to learn how to start building agents with Rowboat.\n',

I\'ve been [hacking](https://youtu.be/8bIHcttkOTE) on [AI agents](https://theouterloop.substack.com) for [a while](https://humanlayer.dev). \n\n\n**I\'ve tried every agent framework out there**, from the plug-and-play crew/langchains to the "minimalist" smolagents of the world to the "production grade" langraph, griptape, etc. \n\n**I\'ve talked to a lot of really strong founders**, in and out of YC, who are all building really impressive things with AI. Most of them are rolling the stack themselves. I don\'t see a lot of frameworks in production customer-facing agents.\n\n**I\'ve been surprised to find** that most of the products out there billing themselves as "AI Agents" are not all that agentic. A lot of them are mostly deterministic code, with LLM steps sprinkled in at just the right points to make the experience truly magical.\n\nAgents, at least the good ones, don\'t follow the ["here\'s your prompt, here\'s a bag of tools, loop until you hit the goal"](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents#agents) pattern. Rather, they are comprised of mostly just software. \n\nSo, I set out to answer:\n\n> ### **What are the principles we can use to build LLM-powered software that is actually good enough to put in the hands of production customers?**\n\nWelcome to 12-factor agents. As every Chicago mayor since Daley has consistently plastered all over the city\'s major airports, we\'re glad you\'re here.\n\n*Special thanks to [@iantbutler01](https://github.com/iantbutler01), [@tnm](https://github.com/tnm), [@hellovai](https://www.github.com/hellovai), [@stantonk](https://www.github.com/stantonk), [@balanceiskey](https://www.github.com/balanceiskey), [@AdjectiveAllison](https://www.github.com/AdjectiveAllison), [@pfbyjy](https://www.github.com/pfbyjy), [@a-churchill](https://www.github.com/a-churchill), and the SF MLOps community for early feedback on this guide.*\n\n## The Short Version: The 12 Factors\n\nEven if LLMs [continue to get exponentially more powerful](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/content/factor-10-small-focused-agents.md#what-if-llms-get-smarter), there will be core engineering techniques that make LLM-powered software more reliable, more scalable, and easier to maintain.\n\n- [How We Got Here: A Brief History of Software](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/content/brief-history-of-software.md)\n- [Factor 1: Natural Language to Tool Calls](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/content/factor-1-natural-language-to-tool-calls.md)\n- [Factor 2: Own your prompts](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/content/factor-2-own-your-prompts.md)\n- [Factor 3: Own your context window](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/content/factor-3-own-your-context-window.md)\n- [Factor 4: Tools are just structured outputs](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/content/factor-4-tools-are-structured-outputs.md)\n- [Factor 5: Unify execution state and business state](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/content/factor-5-unify-execution-state.md)\n- [Factor 6: Launch/Pause/Resume with simple APIs](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/content/factor-6-launch-pause-resume.md)\n- [Factor 7: Contact humans with tool calls](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/content/factor-7-contact-humans-with-tools.md)\n- [Factor 8: Own your control flow](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/content/factor-8-own-your-control-flow.md)\n- [Factor 9: Compact Errors into Context Window](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/content/factor-9-compact-errors.md)\n- [Factor 10: Small, Focused Agents](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/content/factor-10-small-focused-agents.md)\n- [Factor 11: Trigger from anywhere, meet users where they are](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/content/factor-11-trigger-from-anywhere.md)\n- [Factor 12: Make your agent a stateless reducer](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/content/factor-12-stateless-reducer.md)\n\n### Visual Nav\n\n|    |    |    |\n|----|----|-----|\n|[![factor 1](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/img/110-natural-language-tool-calls.png)](./content/factor-1-natural-language-to-tool-calls.md) | [![factor 2](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/img/120-own-your-prompts.png)](./content/factor-2-own-your-prompts.md) | [![factor 3](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/img/130-own-your-context-building.png)](./content/factor-3-own-your-context-window.md) |\n|[![factor 4](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/img/140-tools-are-just-structured-outputs.png)](./content/factor-4-tools-are-structured-outputs.md) | [![factor 5](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/img/150-unify-state.png)](./content/factor-5-unify-execution-state.md) | [![factor 6](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/img/160-pause-resume-with-simple-apis.png)](./content/factor-6-launch-pause-resume.md) |\n| [![factor 7](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/img/170-contact-humans-with-tools.png)](./content/factor-7-contact-humans-with-tools.md) | [![factor 8](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/img/180-control-flow.png)](./content/factor-8-own-your-control-flow.md) | [![factor 9](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/img/190-factor-9-errors-static.png)](./content/factor-9-compact-errors.md) |\n| [![factor 10](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/img/1a0-small-focused-agents.png)](./content/factor-10-small-focused-agents.md) | [![factor 11](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/img/1b0-trigger-from-anywhere.png)](./content/factor-11-trigger-from-anywhere.md) | [![factor 12](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/img/1c0-stateless-reducer.png)](./content/factor-12-stateless-reducer.md) |\n\n## How we got here\n\nFor a deeper dive on my agent journey and what led us here, check out [A Brief History of Software](./content/brief-history-of-software.md) - a quick summary here:\n\n### The promise of agents\n\nWe\'re gonna talk a lot about Directed Graphs (DGs) and their Acyclic friends, DAGs. I\'ll start by pointing out that...well...software is a directed graph. There\'s a reason we used to represent programs as flow charts.\n\n![010-software-dag](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/img/010-software-dag.png)\n\n### From code to DAGs\n\nAround 20 years ago, we started to see DAG orchestrators become popular. We\'re talking classics like [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/), [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io/), some predecessors, and some newer ones like ([dagster](https://dagster.io/), [inggest](https://www.inngest.com/), [windmill](https://www.windmill.dev/)). These followed the same graph pattern, with the added benefit of observability, modularity, retries, administration, etc.\n\n![015-dag-orchestrators](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/img/015-dag-orchestrators.png)\n\n### The promise of agents\n\nI\'m not the first [person to say this](https://youtu.be/Dc99-zTMyMg?si=bcT0hIwWij2mR-40&t=73), but my biggest takeaway when I started learning about agents, was that you get to throw the DAG away. Instead of software engineers coding each step and edge case, you can give the agent a goal and a set of transitions:\n\n![025-agent-dag](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/img/025-agent-dag.png)\n\nAnd let the LLM make decisions in real time to figure out the path\n\n![026-agent-dag-lines](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/img/026-agent-dag-lines.png)\n\nThe promise here is that you write less software, you just give the LLM the "edges" of the graph and let it figure out the nodes. You can recover from errors, you can write less code, and you may find that LLMs find novel solutions to problems.\n\n\n### Agents as loops\n\nAs we\'ll see later, it turns out this doesn\'t quite work.\n\nLet\'s dive one step deeper - with agents you\'ve got this loop consisting of 3 steps:\n\n1. LLM determines the next step in the workflow, outputting structured json ("tool calling")\n2. Deterministic code executes the tool call\n3. The result is appended to the context window \n4. Repeat until the next step is determined to be "done"\n\n```python\ninitial_event = {"message": "..."}\ncontext = [initial_event]\nwhile True:\n  next_step = await llm.determine_next_step(context)\n  context.append(next_step)\n\n  if (next_step.intent === "done"):\n    return next_step.final_answer\n\n  result = await execute_step(next_step)\n  context.append(result)\n```\n\nOur initial context is just the starting event (maybe a user message, maybe a cron fired, maybe a webhook, etc), and we ask the llm to choose the next step (tool) or to determine that we\'re done.\n\nHere\'s a multi-step example:\n\n[![027-agent-loop-animation](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/img/027-agent-loop-animation.gif)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3beb0966-fdb1-4c12-a47f-ed4e8240f8fd)\n\n<details>\n<summary><a href="https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/img/027-agent-loop-animation.gif">GIF Version</a></summary>\n\n![027-agent-loop-animation](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/img/027-agent-loop-animation.gif)]\n\n</details>\n\n## Why 12-factor agents?\n\nAt the end of the day, this approach just doesn\'t work as well as we want it to.\n\nIn building HumanLayer, I\'ve talked to at least 100 SaaS builders (mostly technical founders) looking to make their existing product more agentic. The journey usually goes something like:\n\n1. Decide you want to build an agent\n2. Product design, UX mapping, what problems to solve\n3. Want to move fast, so grab $FRAMEWORK and *get to building*\n4. Get to 70-80% quality bar \n5. Realize that 80% isn\'t good enough for most customer-facing features\n6. Realize that getting past 80% requires reverse-engineering the framework, prompts, flow, etc.\n7. Start over from scratch\n\n<details>\n<summary>Random Disclaimers</summary>\n\n**DISCLAIMER**: I\'m not sure the exact right place to say this, but here seems as good as any: **this in BY NO MEANS meant to be a dig on either the many frameworks out there, or the pretty dang smart people who work on them**. They enable incredible things and have accelerated the AI ecosystem. \n\nI hope that one outcome of this post is that agent framework builders can learn from the journeys of myself and others, and make frameworks even better. \n\nEspecially for builders who want to move fast but need deep control.\n\n**DISCLAIMER 2**: I\'m not going to talk about MCP. I\'m sure you can see where it fits in.\n\n**DISCLAIMER 3**: I\'m using mostly typescript, for [reasons](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dexterihorthy_llms-typescript-aiagents-activity-7290858296679313408-Lh9e?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAA4oHTkByAiD-wZjnGsMBUL_JT6nyyhOh30) but all this stuff works in python or any other language you prefer. \n\n\nAnyways back to the thing...\n\n</details>\n\n### Design Patterns for great LLM applications\n\nAfter digging through hundreds of AI libriaries and working with dozens of founders, my instinct is this:\n\n1. There are some core things that make agents great\n2. Going all in on a framework and building what is essentially a greenfield rewrite may be counter-productive\n3. There are some core principles that make agents great, and you will get most/all of them if you pull in a framework\n4. BUT, the fastest way I\'ve seen for builders to get high-quality AI software in the hands of customers is to take small, modular concepts from agent building, and incorporate them into their existing product\n5. These modular concepts from agents can be defined and applied by most skilled software engineers, even if they don\'t have an AI background\n\n> #### The fastest way I\'ve seen for builders to get good AI software in the hands of customers is to take small, modular concepts from agent building, and incorporate them into their existing product\n\n\n## The 12 Factors (again)\n\n\n- [How We Got Here: A Brief History of Software](./content/brief-history-of-software.md)\n- [Factor 1: Natural Language to Tool Calls](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/content/factor-1-natural-language-to-tool-calls.md)\n- [Factor 2: Own your prompts](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/content/factor-2-own-your-prompts.md)\n- [Factor 3: Own your context window](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/content/factor-3-own-your-context-window.md)\n- [Factor 4: Tools are just structured outputs](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/content/factor-4-tools-are-structured-outputs.md)\n- [Factor 5: Unify execution state and business state](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/content/factor-5-unify-execution-state.md)\n- [Factor 6: Launch/Pause/Resume with simple APIs](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/content/factor-6-launch-pause-resume.md)\n- [Factor 7: Contact humans with tool calls](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/content/factor-7-contact-humans-with-tools.md)\n- [Factor 8: Own your control flow](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/content/factor-8-own-your-control-flow.md)\n- [Factor 9: Compact Errors into Context Window](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/content/factor-9-compact-errors.md)\n- [Factor 10: Small, Focused Agents](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/content/factor-10-small-focused-agents.md)\n- [Factor 11: Trigger from anywhere, meet users where they are](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/content/factor-11-trigger-from-anywhere.md)\n- [Factor 12: Make your agent a stateless reducer](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/content/factor-12-stateless-reducer.md)\n\n## Honorable Mentions / other advice\n\n- [Factor 13: Pre-fetch all the context you might need](./content/appendix-13-pre-fetch.md)\n\n## Related Resources\n\n- Contribute to this guide [here](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents)\n- [I talked about a lot of this on an episode of the Tool Use podcast](https://youtu.be/8bIHcttkOTE) in March 2025\n- I write about some of this stuff at [The Outer Loop](https://theouterloop.substack.com)\n- I do [webinars about Maximizing LLM Performance](https://github.com/hellovai/ai-that-works/tree/main) with [@hellovai](https://github.com/hellovai)\n- We build OSS agents with this methodology under [got-agents/agents](https://github.com/got-agents/agents)\n- We ignored all our own advice and built a [framework for running distributed agents in kubernetes](https://github.com/humanlayer/kubechain)\n- Other links from this guide:\n  - [12 Factor Apps](https://12factor.net)\n  - [Building Effective Agents (Anthropic)](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents#agents)\n  - [Prompts are Functions](https://thedataexchange.media/baml-revolution-in-ai-engineering/ )\n  - [Library patterns: Why frameworks are evil](https://tomasp.net/blog/2015/library-frameworks/)\n  - [The Wrong Abstraction](https://sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction)\n  - [Mailcrew Agent](https://github.com/dexhorthy/mailcrew)\n  - [Mailcrew Demo Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_cKnoPC_Oo)\n  - [Chainlit Demo](https://x.com/chainlit_io/status/1858613325921480922)\n  - [TypeScript for LLMs](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dexterihorthy_llms-typescript-aiagents-activity-7290858296679313408-Lh9e)\n  - [Schema Aligned Parsing](https://www.boundaryml.com/blog/schema-aligned-parsing)\n  - [Function Calling vs Structured Outputs vs JSON Mode](https://www.vellum.ai/blog/when-should-i-use-function-calling-structured-outputs-or-json-mode)\n  - [BAML on GitHub](https://github.com/boundaryml/baml)\n  - [OpenAI JSON vs Function Calling](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/llm/openai_json_vs_function_calling/)\n  - [Outer Loop Agents](https://theouterloop.substack.com/p/openais-realtime-api-is-a-step-towards)\n  - [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/)\n  - [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io/)\n  - [Dagster](https://dagster.io/)\n  - [Inngest](https://www.inngest.dev/)\n  - [Windmill](https://www.windmill.dev/)\n  - [The AI Agent Index (MIT)](https://aiagentindex.mit.edu/)\n  - [NotebookLM on Finding Model Capability Boundaries](https://open.substack.com/pub/swyx/p/notebooklm?selection=08e1187c-cfee-4c63-93c9-71216640a5f8)\n\n\n\n\n',

You\'re using placeholder credentials ("cooluser:coolpassword")\n      \n        To fix this, you have two options:\n      \n        1. Use a local MongoDB instance by changing line 29-30 in app.js to:\n        const dev_db_url = "mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/local_library";\n        2. Or correctly set up MongoDB Atlas:\n          - Log into Atlas at https://cloud.mongodb.com\n          - Go to Network Access and add your current IP to whitelist\n          - Create proper database credentials\n          - Update the connection string with real credentials\n      \n        Which option would you like to proceed with?\n    ```\n',

If you need to persist data across containers being created and destroyed,\nyou can mount a volume to the /data directory. Note that this image is intended for\ndevelopment, demo, and testing environments and persisting data to an external volume\ndoesn\'t change that.

Don\'t hesitate to reach for assistance at [Discussion](https://github.com/tw93/Pake/discussions)!\n2. **For developers**: ‚ÄúCommand-Line Packaging‚Äù supports macOS fully. For Windows/Linux users, it requires some tinkering. [Configure your environment](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) before getting started.\n3. **For hackers**: For people who are good at both front-end development and Rust, how about customizing your apps\' function more with the following [Customized Development](#development)?\n\n## Command-Line Packaging\n\n![Pake](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tw93/static/main/pake/pake.gif)\n\n**Pake provides a command line tool, making the flow of package customization quicker and easier. See [documentation](./bin/README.md) for more information.**\n\n```bash\n# Install with npm\nnpm install -g pake-cli\n\n# Command usage\npake url [OPTIONS]...\n\n# Feel free to play with Pake! It might take a while to prepare the environment the first time you launch Pake.\npake https://weekly.tw93.fun --name Weekly --hide-title-bar\n\n```\n\nIf you are new to the command line, you can compile packages online with _GitHub Actions_. See the [Tutorial](<https://github.com/tw93/Pake/wiki/Online-Compilation-(used-by-ordinary-users)>) for more information.\n\n## Development\n\nPrepare your environment before starting. Make sure you have Rust `>=1.63` and Node `>=16` (e.g., `16.18.1`) installed on your computer. For installation guidance, see [Tauri documentation](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/).\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with these, it is better to try out the above tool to pack with one click.\n\n```sh\n# Install Dependencies\nnpm i\n\n# Local development [Right-click to open debug mode.]\nnpm run dev\n\n# Pack application\nnpm run build\n```\n\n## Advanced Usage\n\n1. You can refer to the [codebase structure](https://github.com/tw93/Pake/wiki/Description-of-Pake\'s-code-structure) before working on Pake, which will help you much in development.\n2. Modify the `url` and `productName` fields in the `pake.json` file under the src-tauri directory, the "domain" field in the `tauri.config.json` file needs to be modified synchronously, as well as the `icon` and `identifier` fields in the `tauri.xxx.conf.json` file. You can select an `icon` from the `icons` directory or download one from [macOSicons](https://macosicons.com/#/) to match your product needs.\n3. For configurations on window properties, you can modify the `pake.json` file to change the value of `width`, `height`, `fullscreen` (or not), `resizable` (or not) of the `windows` property. To adapt to the immersive header on Mac, change `hideTitleBar` to `true`, look for the `Header` element, and add the `padding-top` property.\n4. For advanced usages such as style rewriting, advertisement removal, JS injection, container message communication, and user-defined shortcut keys, see [Advanced Usage of Pake](https://github.com/tw93/Pake/wiki/Advanced-Usage-of-Pake).\n\n## Developers\n\nPake\'s development can not be without these Hackers. They contributed a lot of capabilities for Pake.

And since Standard Schema is a specification, they can do so with no additional runtime dependencies. Integrate once, validate anywhere.\n\n## Who designed it?\n\nThe spec was designed by the creators of Zod, Valibot, and ArkType. Recent versions of these libraries already implement the spec (see the [full list of compatible libraries](#what-schema-libraries-implement-the-spec) below).\n\n## The interface\n\nThe specification consists of a single TypeScript interface `StandardSchemaV1` to be implemented by any schema library wishing to be spec-compliant.\n\nThis interface can be found below in its entirety. Libraries wishing to implement the spec can copy/paste the code block below into their codebase. It\'s also available at `@standard-schema/spec` on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@standard-schema/spec) and [JSR](https://jsr.io/@standard-schema/spec). There will be zero changes without a major version bump.\n\n```ts\n/** The Standard Schema interface. */\nexport interface StandardSchemaV1<Input = unknown, Output = Input> {\n  /** The Standard Schema properties. */\n  readonly \'~standard\': StandardSchemaV1.Props<Input, Output>;\n}\n\nexport declare namespace StandardSchemaV1 {\n  /** The Standard Schema properties interface. */\n  export interface Props<Input = unknown, Output = Input> {\n    /** The version number of the standard. */\n    readonly version: 1;\n    /** The vendor name of the schema library. */\n    readonly vendor: string;\n    /** Validates unknown input values. */\n    readonly validate: (\n      value: unknown\n    ) => Result<Output> | Promise<Result<Output>>;\n    /** Inferred types associated with the schema. */\n    readonly types?: Types<Input, Output> | undefined;\n  }\n\n  /** The result interface of the validate function. */\n  export type Result<Output> = SuccessResult<Output> | FailureResult;\n\n  /** The result interface if validation succeeds. */\n  export interface SuccessResult<Output> {\n    /** The typed output value. */\n    readonly value: Output;\n    /** The non-existent issues. */\n    readonly issues?: undefined;\n  }\n\n  /** The result interface if validation fails. */\n  export interface FailureResult {\n    /** The issues of failed validation. */\n    readonly issues: ReadonlyArray<Issue>;\n  }\n\n  /** The issue interface of the failure output. */\n  export interface Issue {\n    /** The error message of the issue. */\n    readonly message: string;\n    /** The path of the issue, if any. */\n    readonly path?: ReadonlyArray<PropertyKey | PathSegment> | undefined;\n  }\n\n  /** The path segment interface of the issue. */\n  export interface PathSegment {\n    /** The key representing a path segment. */\n    readonly key: PropertyKey;\n  }\n\n  /** The Standard Schema types interface. */\n  export interface Types<Input = unknown, Output = Input> {\n    /** The input type of the schema. */\n    readonly input: Input;\n    /** The output type of the schema. */\n    readonly output: Output;\n  }\n\n  /** Infers the input type of a Standard Schema. */\n  export type InferInput<Schema extends StandardSchemaV1> = NonNullable<\n    Schema[\'~standard\'][\'types\']\n  >[\'input\'];\n\n  /** Infers the output type of a Standard Schema. */\n  export type InferOutput<Schema extends StandardSchemaV1> = NonNullable<\n    Schema[\'~standard\'][\'types\']\n  >[\'output\'];\n}\n```\n\n## Design goals\n\nThe specification meets a few primary design objectives:\n\n- **Support runtime validation.** Given a Standard Schema compatible validator, you should be able to validate data with it (duh). Any validation errors should be presented in a standardized format.\n- **Support static type inference.** For TypeScript libraries that do type inference, the specification provides a standard way for them to "advertise" their inferred type, so it can be extracted and used by external tools.\n- **Minimal.** It should be easy for libraries to implement this spec in a few lines of code that call their existing functions/methods.\n- **Avoid API conflicts.** The entire spec is tucked inside a single object property called `~standard`, which avoids potential naming conflicts with the API surface of existing libraries.\n- **Do no harm to DX.** The `~standard` property is tilde-prefixed to [de-prioritize it in autocompletion](https://x.com/colinhacks/status/1816860780459073933). By contrast, an underscore-prefixed property would show up before properties/methods with alphanumeric names.\n\n## What schema libraries implement the spec?\n\nThese are the libraries that have already implemented the Standard Schema interface.

Start by copying the specification file above into your library. It consists of types only.\n\nThen implement the spec by adding the `~standard` property to your validator objects/instances. We recommend using `extends` / `implements` to ensure static agreement with the interface. It doesn\'t matter whether your schema library returns plain objects, functions, or class instances. The only thing that matters is that the `~standard` property is defined somehow.\n\nHere\'s a simple worked example of a string validator that implements the spec.\n\n```ts\nimport type {StandardSchemaV1} from \'@standard-schema/spec\';\n\n// Step 1: Define the schema interface\ninterface StringSchema extends StandardSchemaV1<string> {\n  type: \'string\';\n  message: string;\n}\n\n// Step 2: Implement the schema interface\nfunction string(message: string = \'Invalid type\'): StringSchema {\n  return {\n    type: \'string\',\n    message,\n    \'~standard\': {\n      version: 1,\n      vendor: \'valizod\',\n      validate(value) {\n        return typeof value === \'string\' ? {value} : {issues: [{message}]};\n      },\n    },\n  };\n}\n```\n\nWe recommend defining the `~standard.validate()` function in terms of your library\'s existing validation functions/methods. Ideally implementing the spec only requires a handful of lines of code.\n\nAvoid returning `Promise` from `~standard.validate()` unless absolutely necessary. Some third-party libraries may not support async validation.\n\n## How do I accept Standard Schemas in my library?\n\nThird-party libraries and frameworks can leverage the Standard Schema spec to accept user-defined schemas in a type-safe way.\n\nTo get started, copy and paste the specification file into your project. Alternatively (if you are okay with the extra dependency), you can install the `@standard-schema/spec` package from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@standard-schema/spec) or [JSR](https://jsr.io/@standard-schema/spec) as a dependency. _It is not recommended to install as a dev dependency, see the [associated FAQ](#can-i-add-it-as-a-dev-dependency) for details_.\n\n```sh\nnpm install @standard-schema/spec       # npm\nyarn add @standard-schema/spec          # yarn\npnpm add @standard-schema/spec          # pnpm\nbun add @standard-schema/spec           # bun\ndeno add jsr:@standard-schema/spec      # deno\n```\n\nHere\'s is an simple example of a generic function that accepts an arbitrary spec-compliant validator and uses it to parse some data.\n\n```ts\nimport type {StandardSchemaV1} from \'@standard-schema/spec\';\n\nexport async function standardValidate<T extends StandardSchemaV1>(\n  schema: T,\n  input: StandardSchemaV1.InferInput<T>\n): Promise<StandardSchemaV1.InferOutput<T>> {\n  let result = schema[\'~standard\'].validate(input);\n  if (result instanceof Promise) result = await result;\n\n  // if the `issues` field exists, the validation failed\n  if (result.issues) {\n    throw new Error(JSON.stringify(result.issues, null, 2));\n  }\n\n  return result.value;\n}\n```\n\nThis concise function can accept inputs from any spec-compliant schema library.\n\n```ts\nimport * as z from \'zod\';\nimport * as v from \'valibot\';\nimport {type} from \'arktype\';\n\nconst zodResult = await standardValidate(z.string(), \'hello\');\nconst valibotResult = await standardValidate(v.string(), \'hello\');\nconst arktypeResult = await standardValidate(type(\'string\'), \'hello\');\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\nThese are the most frequently asked questions about Standard Schema. If your question is not listed, feel free to create an issue.\n\n### Do I need to add `@standard-schema/spec` as a dependency?\n\nNo. The `@standard-schema/spec` package is completely optional. You can just copy and paste the types into your project. We guarantee no breaking changes without a major version bump.\n\nIf you don\'t mind additional dependencies, you can add `@standard-schema/spec` as a dependency and consume it with `import type`. The `@standard-schema/spec` package contains no runtime code and only exports types.\n\n### Can I add it as a dev dependency?\n\nDespite being types-only, you should _not_ install `@standard-schema/spec` as a dev dependency. By accepting Standard Schemas as part of your public API, the Standard Schema interface becomes a part of your library\'s public API. As such, it _must_ be available whenever/wherever your library gets installed, even in production installs. For this to happen, it must be installed as a regular dependency.\n\n### Why did you prefix the `~standard` property with `~`?\n\nThe goal of prefixing the key with `~` is to both avoid conflicts with existing API surfaces and to de-prioritize these keys in auto-complete. The `~` character is one of the few ASCII characters that occurs after `A-Za-z0-9` lexicographically, so VS Code puts these suggestions at the bottom of the list.\n\n![Screenshot showing the de-prioritization of the `~` prefix keys in VS Code.](https://github.com/standard-schema/standard-schema/assets/3084745/5dfc0219-7531-481e-9691-cff5bc471378)\n\n### Why not use a symbol key?\n\nIn TypeScript, using a plain `Symbol` inline as a key always collapses to a simple `symbol` type. This would cause conflicts with other schema properties that use symbols.\n\n```ts\nconst object = {\n  [Symbol.for(\'~output\')]: \'some data\',\n};\n// { [k: symbol]: string }\n```\n\nUnique symbols can also be declared in a "nominal" way that won\'t collapse. In this case the symbol key is sorted alphabetically in autocomplete according to the symbol\'s variable name.\n\n![Screenshot showing the prioritization of external symbols in VS Code](https://github.com/standard-schema/standard-schema/assets/3084745/82c47820-90c3-4163-a838-858b987a6bea)\n\nThus, these symbol keys don\'t get sorted to the bottom of the autocomplete list, unlike tilde-prefixed string keys.\n\n### How to only allow synchronous validation?\n\nThe `~validate` function might return a synchronous value _or_ a `Promise`. If you only accept synchronous validation, you can simply throw an error if the returned value is an instance of `Promise`.

It offers:\n\n‚ú® **Simplicity**: the logic for agents fits in ~1,000 lines of code (see [agents.py](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents/blob/main/src/smolagents/agents.py)). We kept abstractions to their minimal shape above raw code!\n\nüßë‚Äçüíª **First-class support for Code Agents**. Our [`CodeAgent`](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/reference/agents#smolagents.CodeAgent) writes its actions in code (as opposed to "agents being used to write code"). To make it secure, we support executing in sandboxed environments via [E2B](https://e2b.dev/) or via Docker.\n\nü§ó **Hub integrations**: you can [share/pull tools or agents to/from the Hub](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/reference/tools#smolagents.Tool.from_hub) for instant sharing of the most efficient agents!\n\nüåê **Model-agnostic**: smolagents supports any LLM. It can be a local `transformers` or `ollama` model, one of [many providers on the Hub](https://huggingface.co/blog/inference-providers), or any model from OpenAI, Anthropic and many others via our [LiteLLM](https://www.litellm.ai/) integration.\n\nüëÅÔ∏è **Modality-agnostic**: Agents support text, vision, video, even audio inputs! Cf [this tutorial](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/examples/web_browser) for vision.\n\nüõ†Ô∏è **Tool-agnostic**: you can use tools from [LangChain](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/reference/tools#smolagents.Tool.from_langchain), [MCP](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/reference/tools#smolagents.ToolCollection.from_mcp), you can even use a [Hub Space](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/reference/tools#smolagents.Tool.from_space) as a tool.\n\nFull documentation can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/index).\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Check the our [launch blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/smolagents) to learn more about `smolagents`!\n\n## Quick demo\n\nFirst install the package.\n```bash\npip install smolagents\n```\nThen define your agent, give it the tools it needs and run it!\n```py\nfrom smolagents import CodeAgent, DuckDuckGoSearchTool, InferenceClientModel\n\nmodel = InferenceClientModel()\nagent = CodeAgent(tools=[DuckDuckGoSearchTool()], model=model)\n\nagent.run("How many seconds would it take for a leopard at full speed to run through Pont des Arts?")\n```\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd0226e2-7479-4102-aea0-57c22ca47884\n\nYou can even share your agent to the Hub, as a Space repository:\n```py\nagent.push_to_hub("m-ric/my_agent")\n\n# agent.from_hub("m-ric/my_agent") to load an agent from Hub\n```\n\nOur library is LLM-agnostic: you could switch the example above to any inference provider.\n\n<details>\n<summary> <b>InferenceClientModel, gateway for all <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/inference-providers/index">inference providers</a> supported on HF</b></summary>\n\n```py\nfrom smolagents import InferenceClientModel\n\nmodel = InferenceClientModel(\n    model_id="deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1",\n    provider="together",\n)\n```\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary> <b>LiteLLM to access 100+ LLMs</b></summary>\n\n```py\nfrom smolagents import LiteLLMModel\n\nmodel = LiteLLMModel(\n    model_id="anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-latest",\n    temperature=0.2,\n    api_key=os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"]\n)\n```\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary> <b>OpenAI-compatible servers</b></summary>\n\n```py\nimport os\nfrom smolagents import OpenAIServerModel\n\nmodel = OpenAIServerModel(\n    model_id="deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1",\n    api_base="https://api.together.xyz/v1/", # Leave this blank to query OpenAI servers.\n    api_key=os.environ["TOGETHER_API_KEY"], # Switch to the API key for the server you\'re targeting.\n)\n```\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary> <b>Local `transformers` model</b></summary>\n\n```py\nfrom smolagents import TransformersModel\n\nmodel = TransformersModel(\n    model_id="Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct",\n    max_new_tokens=4096,\n    device_map="auto"\n)\n```\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary> <b>Azure models</b></summary>\n\n```py\nimport os\nfrom smolagents import AzureOpenAIServerModel\n\nmodel = AzureOpenAIServerModel(\n    model_id = os.environ.get("AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL"),\n    azure_endpoint=os.environ.get("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"),\n    api_key=os.environ.get("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"),\n    api_version=os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_VERSION")    \n)\n```\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary> <b>Amazon Bedrock models</b></summary>\n\n```py\nimport os\nfrom smolagents import AmazonBedrockServerModel\n\nmodel = AmazonBedrockServerModel(\n    model_id = os.environ.get("AMAZON_BEDROCK_MODEL_ID") \n)\n```\n</details>\n\n## CLI\n\nYou can run agents from CLI using two commands: `smolagent` and `webagent`.\n\n`smolagent` is a generalist command to run a multi-step `CodeAgent` that can be equipped with various tools.\n\n```bash\nsmolagent "Plan a trip to Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka between Mar 28 and Apr 7."  --model-type "InferenceClientModel" --model-id "Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct" --imports "pandas numpy" --tools "web_search"\n```\n\nMeanwhile `webagent`¬†is a specific web-browsing agent using [helium](https://github.com/mherrmann/helium) (read more [here](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents/blob/main/src/smolagents/vision_web_browser.py)).\n\nFor instance:\n```bash\nwebagent "go to xyz.com/men, get to sale section, click the first clothing item you see. Get the product details, and the price, return them. note that I\'m shopping from France" --model-type "LiteLLMModel" --model-id "gpt-4o"\n```\n\n## How do Code agents work?\n\nOur [`CodeAgent`](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/reference/agents#smolagents.CodeAgent) works mostly like classical ReAct agents - the exception being that the LLM engine writes its actions as Python code snippets.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TB\n    Task[User Task]\n    Memory[agent.memory]\n    Generate[Generate from agent.model]\n    Execute[Execute Code action - Tool calls are written as functions]\n    Answer[Return the argument given to \'final_answer\']\n\n    Task -->|Add task to agent.memory| Memory\n\n    subgraph ReAct[ReAct loop]\n        Memory -->|Memory as chat messages| Generate\n        Generate -->|Parse output to extract code action| Execute\n        Execute -->|No call to \'final_answer\' tool => Store execution logs in memory and keep running| Memory\n    end\n    \n    Execute -->|Call to \'final_answer\' tool| Answer\n\n    %% Styling\n    classDef default fill:#d4b702,stroke:#8b7701,color:#ffffff\n    classDef io fill:#4a5568,stroke:#2d3748,color:#ffffff\n    \n    class Task,Answer io\n```\n\nActions are now Python code snippets. Hence, tool calls will be performed as Python function calls. For instance, here is how the agent can perform web search over several websites in one single action:\n```py\nrequests_to_search = ["gulf of mexico america", "greenland denmark", "tariffs"]\nfor request in requests_to_search:\n    print(f"Here are the search results for {request}:", web_search(request))\n```\n\nWriting actions as code snippets is demonstrated to work better than the current industry practice of letting the LLM output a dictionary of the tools it wants to call: [uses 30% fewer steps](https://huggingface.co/papers/2402.01030) (thus 30% fewer LLM calls) and [reaches higher performance on difficult benchmarks](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.01747). Head to [our high-level intro to agents](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/conceptual_guides/intro_agents) to learn more on that.\n\nEspecially, since code execution can be a security concern (arbitrary code execution!), we provide options at runtime:\n  - a secure python interpreter to run code more safely in your environment (more secure than raw code execution but still risky)\n  - a sandboxed environment using [E2B](https://e2b.dev/) or Docker (removes the risk to your own system).\n\nOn top of this [`CodeAgent`](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/reference/agents#smolagents.CodeAgent) class, we still support the standard [`ToolCallingAgent`](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/reference/agents#smolagents.ToolCallingAgent) that writes actions as JSON/text blobs. But we recommend always using `CodeAgent`.\n\n## How smol is this library?\n\nWe strived to keep abstractions to a strict minimum: the main code in `agents.py` has <1,000 lines of code.\nStill, we implement several types of agents: `CodeAgent` writes its actions as Python code snippets, and the more classic `ToolCallingAgent` leverages built-in tool calling methods. We also have multi-agent hierarchies, import from tool collections, remote code execution, vision models...\n\nBy the way, why use a framework at all? Well, because a big part of this stuff is non-trivial. For instance, the code agent has to keep a consistent format for code throughout its system prompt, its parser, the execution. So our framework handles this complexity for you. But of course we still encourage you to hack into the source code and use only the bits that you need, to the exclusion of everything else!\n\n## How strong are open models for agentic workflows?\n\nWe\'ve created [`CodeAgent`](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/reference/agents#smolagents.CodeAgent) instances with some leading models, and compared them on [this benchmark](https://huggingface.co/datasets/m-ric/agents_medium_benchmark_2) that gathers questions from a few different benchmarks to propose a varied blend of challenges.\n\n[Find the benchmarking code here](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents/blob/main/examples/smolagents_benchmark/run.py) for more detail on the agentic setup used, and see a comparison of using LLMs code agents compared to vanilla (spoilers: code agents works better).\n\n<p align="center">\n    <img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/smolagents/benchmark_code_agents.jpeg" alt="benchmark of different models on agentic workflows. Open model DeepSeek-R1 beats closed-source models." width=60% max-width=500px>\n</p>\n\nThis comparison shows that open-source models can now take on the best closed models!\n\n## Security\n\nSecurity is a critical consideration when working with code-executing agents. Our library provides:\n- Sandboxed execution options using [E2B](https://e2b.dev/) or Docker\n- Best practices for running agent code securely\n\nFor security policies, vulnerability reporting, and more information on secure agent execution, please see our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md).\n\n## Contribute\n\nEveryone is welcome to contribute, get started with our [contribution guide](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Cite smolagents\n\nIf you use `smolagents` in your publication, please cite it by using the following BibTeX entry.\n\n```bibtex\n@Misc{smolagents,\n  title =        {`smolagents`: a smol library to build great agentic systems.},\n  author =       {Aymeric Roucher and Albert Villanova del Moral and Thomas Wolf and Leandro von Werra and Erik Kaunism√§ki},\n  howpublished = {\\url{https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents}},\n  year =         {2025}\n}\n```\n',

It is a "Form Backend" which means it allows you to have functional forms that send places without having to write any server side code yourself! We have a hosted option available here: <a href="https://formbee.dev">FormBee Website</a> or you can self-host it!</p>\n\n---\n\n## Table of Contents\n- ‚ú® [Features](#-features)\n- üè† [Self Hosting](#-self-hosting)\n- üîß [Installation/Run Locally](#-installationrun-locally)\n   - üë®‚Äçüíª [Client Side](#-client-side)\n   - üñ• [Server Side](#-server-side)\n- üå± [Contributing](#-contributing)\n- üõ† [Tech Stack](#-tech-stack)\n- üèÜ [Credits](#-credits)\n- üìú [License](#-license)\n\n---\n\n<h2>‚ú® Features</h2>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>üåç <b>Open Source</b>: Free to use, modify, and contribute.</li>\n  <li>üîå <b>Plugins</b>: Easily send your form data to email, <a>Make.com</a>, <a>Telegram</a>, <a>n8n</a>, <a>Discord</a>, or <a>Webhooks</a></li>\n  <li>üîí <b>Captcha</b>: Protect your forms from spam with our (PoW) Proof Of Work captchas.</li>\n  <li>üîë <b>White List Domains</b>: Prevent others from using your form backend by whitelisting domains.</li>\n  <li>‚Ü©Ô∏è <b>Automatic return emails </b>: Automatically send return emails to people who submit your forms.</li>\n  <li>‚ûï <b>More Features </b>: FormBee has more to offer than we can fit in here!

In the <code>docker-images</code> folder of the project you will find many variations of the backend you can host, so you can host just what you want, without the bloat of the things you don\'t want. This is a work in progress, and we\'re constantly working on adding more. You can read more about self hosting in the <a href="https://docs.formbee.dev/docs/category/self-hosting">Official Formbee self-hosting docs</a>. The docs will walk you through pulling the docker images, and running them with the correct environmental variables, then you can host them wherever you like to host your containers!</p>\n\n<h3>üöÜ Railway</h3>\n<p>Formbee has official templates on Railway to make self hosting different Formbee backends as simple as clicking deploy and typing in a few environmental variables.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>üìß <b><a href="https://railway.app/template/NR9kSH">Email Only Template</a></b>: Host just a backend for recieving form data to your email.</li>\n</ul>\n\n---\n\n<h2>üîß Installation/Run Locally</h2>\n\nClone the repo: \n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/FormBee/FormBee.git\n```\n\nFormBee is a monorepo, here are instructions for both the frontend and the backend.\n\n## üë®‚Äçüíª Client Side\n\nEnter client directory: \n```bash\ncd FormBee\\client\\FormBee\n```\n\nInstall dependencies: \n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\nMake your way to ```src/app/global-vars.ts``` and change fetchUrl to ```http://localhost:3000```\n\nRun client side: \n``` bash\nng serve\n```\n\n**With that, the client side should be running, go to [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).**\n## üñ• Server Side\n\nEnter server directory: \n```bash\ncd FormBee/server/formbee\n```\n\nInstall Dependencies: \n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\nCopy .env.example: \n```bash\ncp .env.example .env\n```\n\nConfigure your .env with your test database credentials (modify the ```DEV_DB``` env variables.)\nThe EMAIL env variables you see are for configuring the email which sends submission emails.\n\nMake your way to ```src/data-source.ts``` and comment out the second AppDataSource (Prod env vars), and uncomment the first AppDataSource (Dev env vars).\nLastly, make your way to ```src/index.ts``` and change the redirectUrl variable to ```http://localhost:4200```, this is for CORS.\n\nFinally \n```bash\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n**With that the server should be running.**\n\n---\n\n\n\n<h2>üå± Contributing</h2> <p>We welcome contributions!

        E '# Hivemind\n\n<img align="right" width="224" height="74" title="Hivemind logo"\n     src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/DarthSim/hivemind/master/logo.svg">\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DarthSim/hivemind.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DarthSim/hivemind)\n\nHivemind is a process manager for Procfile-based applications. At the moment, it supports Linux, FreeBSD, and macOS.\n\nProcfile is a simple format to specify types of processes your application provides (such as web application server, background queue process, front-end builder) and commands to run those processes. It can significantly simplify process management for developers and is used by popular Platforms-as-a-Service, such as Heroku and Deis. You can learn more about the `Procfile` format [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/procfile).\n\nThere are some good Procfile-based process management tools, including [foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) by David Dollar, which started it all. The problem with most of those tools is that processes you want to manage start to think they are logging their output into a file, and that can lead to all sorts of problems: severe lagging, losing or breaking colored output. Tools can also add vanity information (unneeded timestamps in logs). Hivemind was created to fix those problems once and for all.\n\nSee this article for a good intro and all the juicy details! [Introducing\nOvermind and Hivemind](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/introducing-overmind-and-hivemind)\n\n<a href="https://evilmartians.com/?utm_source=hivemind">\n<img src="https://evilmartians.com/badges/sponsored-by-evil-martians.svg" alt="Sponsored by Evil Martians" width="236" height="54">\n</a>\n\n## Enter Hivemind\n\nHivemind uses `pty` to capture process output. That fixes any problem with log clipping, delays, and TTY colors other process management tools may have.\n\n**If you would like a process management tool with a lot of features, including [tmux](https://tmux.github.io/) support, restarting and killing individual processes and advanced configuration, you should take a look at Hivemind\'s big brother ‚Äî [Overmind](https://github.com/DarthSim/overmind)!**\n\n## Installation\n\n#### With Homebrew (macOS)\n\n```bash\nbrew install hivemind\n```\n\n#### Download the latest Hivemind release binary\n\nYou can download the latest release [here](https://github.com/DarthSim/hivemind/releases/latest).\n\n#### From Source\n\nYou need Go 1.11 or later to build the project.\n\n```bash\n$ GO111MODULE=on go get -u -f github.com/DarthSim/hivemind\n```\n\n**Note:** You can update Hivemind the same way.\n\n## Usage\n\nHivemind works with a `Procfile`. It may look like this:\n\n```Procfile\nweb: bin/rails server\nworker: bundle exec sidekiq\nassets: gulp watch\n```\n\nTo get started, you just need to run Hivemind from your working directory containing `Procfile`.\n\n```bash\n$ hivemind\n```\n\nIf `Procfile` isn\'t located in your working directory, or named it non-standard as `Procfile.dev`, you can specify the path to it: [**Fun Fact:** Name of the `Procfile` is arbitrary and can be anything, although it is a best practice to name it as `Procfile` for sanity]\n\n```bash\n$ hivemind path/to/your/Procfile\n$ hivemind path/to/your/Procfile.dev\n```\n\nRun `hivemind --help` to see other options. Note that every Hivemind option can be set with corresponding environment variable.\n\n### Environment\n\nIf you need to set specific environment variables before running a `Procfile`, you can specify them in the `.env` file in the current working directory.

It\'s the simplest way to get started but limited to the default configuration.\n\n```html\n<script src="https://mizu.sh/client.js" defer></script>\n```\n\n### ESM _( `.mjs`)_\n\nThis setup requires you to import and start _**mizu.js**_ manually, allowing customization of the rendering process, such as setting the initial context and loading additional directives.\n\n```html\n<script type="module">\n  import Mizu from "https://mizu.sh/client.mjs"\n  await Mizu.render(document.body, { context: { foo: "üåä Yaa, mizu!" } })\n</script>\n```\n\n## Server-side\n\nTo set up _**mizu.js**_ in a server environment, install it locally. _**mizu.js**_ packages are hosted on ![jsr.io/@mizu](https://jsr.io/@mizu).\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n> On the server side...\n>\n> - **Rendering is implicit**, so the `*mizu` attribute is not required.\n> - **Reactivity is disabled**, meaning changes to contexts are not tracked and will not trigger a re-render.\n\n### Deno\n\nDeno supports the `jsr:` specifier natively, allowing you to import _**mizu.js**_ directly.\n\n```ts\nimport Mizu from "jsr:@mizu/render/server"\nawait Mizu.render(`<div *text="foo"></div>`, { context: { foo: "üåä Yaa, mizu!" } })\n```\n\nAlternatively, add it to your project using the Deno CLI.\n\n```bash\ndeno add jsr:@mizu/render\n```\n\n### Other runtimes (NodeJS, Bun, etc.)\n\nAdd _**mizu.js**_ to your project using the JSR npm compatibility layer.\n\n```bash\n# NodeJS\nnpx jsr add @mizu/render\n```\n\n```bash\n# Bun\nbunx jsr add @mizu/render\n```\n\nOnce installed, use it in your project.\n\n```ts\nimport Mizu from "@mizu/render/server"\nawait Mizu.render(`<div *text="foo"></div>`, { context: { foo: "üåä Yaa, mizu!" } })\n```\n\n<!-- @mizu/www/html/mizu/usage.html -->\n\n# üìú License\n\n```\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2024 Simon Lecoq\n```\n\n[`üíï Support mizu.js develoment`](https://github.com/sponsors/lowlighter)\n',

        E '# MarkItDown\n\n[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/markitdown.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/markitdown/)\n![PyPI - Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dd/markitdown)\n[![Built by AutoGen Team](https://img.shields.io/badge/Built%20by-AutoGen%20Team-blue)](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen)\n\n> [!TIP]\n> MarkItDown now offers an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for integration with LLM applications like Claude Desktop. See [markitdown-mcp](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown/tree/main/packages/markitdown-mcp) for more information.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Breaking changes between 0.0.1 to 0.1.0:\n> * Dependencies are now organized into optional feature-groups (further details below). Use `pip install \'markitdown[all]\'` to have backward-compatible behavior. \n> * convert\\_stream() now requires a binary file-like object (e.g., a file opened in binary mode, or an io.BytesIO object). This is a breaking change from the previous version, where it previously also accepted text file-like objects, like io.StringIO.\n> * The DocumentConverter class interface has changed to read from file-like streams rather than file paths. *No temporary files are created anymore*. If you are the maintainer of a plugin, or custom DocumentConverter, you likely need to update your code. Otherwise, if only using the MarkItDown class or CLI (as in these examples), you should not need to change anything.\n\nMarkItDown is a lightweight Python utility for converting various files to Markdown for use with LLMs and related text analysis pipelines. To this end, it is most comparable to [textract](https://github.com/deanmalmgren/textract), but with a focus on preserving important document structure and content as Markdown (including: headings, lists, tables, links, etc.) While the output is often reasonably presentable and human-friendly, it is meant to be consumed by text analysis tools -- and may not be the best option for high-fidelity document conversions for human consumption.\n\nAt present, MarkItDown supports:\n\n- PDF\n- PowerPoint\n- Word\n- Excel\n- Images (EXIF metadata and OCR)\n- Audio (EXIF metadata and speech transcription)\n- HTML\n- Text-based formats (CSV, JSON, XML)\n- ZIP files (iterates over contents)\n- Youtube URLs\n- EPubs\n- ... and more!\n\n## Why Markdown?\n\nMarkdown is extremely close to plain text, with minimal markup or formatting, but still\nprovides a way to represent important document structure. Mainstream LLMs, such as\nOpenAI\'s GPT-4o, natively "_speak_" Markdown, and often incorporate Markdown into their\nresponses unprompted. This suggests that they have been trained on vast amounts of\nMarkdown-formatted text, and understand it well. As a side benefit, Markdown conventions\nare also highly token-efficient.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install MarkItDown, use pip: `pip install \'markitdown[all]\'`. Alternatively, you can install it from the source:\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:microsoft/markitdown.git\ncd markitdown\npip install -e \'packages/markitdown[all]\'\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Command-Line\n\n```bash\nmarkitdown path-to-file.pdf > document.md\n```\n\nOr use `-o` to specify the output file:\n\n```bash\nmarkitdown path-to-file.pdf -o document.md\n```\n\nYou can also pipe content:\n\n```bash\ncat path-to-file.pdf | markitdown\n```\n\n### Optional Dependencies\nMarkItDown has optional dependencies for activating various file formats. Earlier in this document, we installed all optional dependencies with the `[all]` option. However, you can also install them individually for more control. For example:\n\n```bash\npip install \'markitdown[pdf, docx, pptx]\'\n```\n\nwill install only the dependencies for PDF, DOCX, and PPTX files.\n\nAt the moment, the following optional dependencies are available:\n\n* `[all]` Installs all optional dependencies\n* `[pptx]` Installs dependencies for PowerPoint files\n* `[docx]` Installs dependencies for Word files\n* `[xlsx]` Installs dependencies for Excel files\n* `[xls]` Installs dependencies for older Excel files\n* `[pdf]` Installs dependencies for PDF files\n* `[outlook]` Installs dependencies for Outlook messages\n* `[az-doc-intel]` Installs dependencies for Azure Document Intelligence\n* `[audio-transcription]` Installs dependencies for audio transcription of wav and mp3 files\n* `[youtube-transcription]` Installs dependencies for fetching YouTube video transcription\n\n### Plugins\n\nMarkItDown also supports 3rd-party plugins. Plugins are disabled by default. To list installed plugins:\n\n```bash\nmarkitdown --list-plugins\n```\n\nTo enable plugins use:\n\n```bash\nmarkitdown --use-plugins path-to-file.pdf\n```\n\nTo find available plugins, search GitHub for the hashtag `#markitdown-plugin`. To develop a plugin, see `packages/markitdown-sample-plugin`.\n\n### Azure Document Intelligence\n\nTo use Microsoft Document Intelligence for conversion:\n\n```bash\nmarkitdown path-to-file.pdf -o document.md -d -e "<document_intelligence_endpoint>"\n```\n\nMore information about how to set up an Azure Document Intelligence Resource can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/how-to-guides/create-document-intelligence-resource?view=doc-intel-4.0.0)\n\n### Python API\n\nBasic usage in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom markitdown import MarkItDown\n\nmd = MarkItDown(enable_plugins=False) # Set to True to enable plugins\nresult = md.convert("test.xlsx")\nprint(result.text_content)\n```\n\nDocument Intelligence conversion in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom markitdown import MarkItDown\n\nmd = MarkItDown(docintel_endpoint="<document_intelligence_endpoint>")\nresult = md.convert("test.pdf")\nprint(result.text_content)\n```\n\nTo use Large Language Models for image descriptions, provide `llm_client` and `llm_model`:\n\n```python\nfrom markitdown import MarkItDown\nfrom openai import OpenAI\n\nclient = OpenAI()\nmd = MarkItDown(llm_client=client, llm_model="gpt-4o")\nresult = md.convert("example.jpg")\nprint(result.text_content)\n```\n\n### Docker\n\n```sh\ndocker build -t markitdown:latest .\ndocker run --rm -i markitdown:latest < ~/your-file.pdf > output.md\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis project welcomes contributions and suggestions.

        E '# RAG From Scratch\n\nLLMs are trained on a large but fixed corpus of data, limiting their ability to reason about private or recent information. Fine-tuning is one way to mitigate this, but is often [not well-suited for facutal recall](https://www.anyscale.com/blog/fine-tuning-is-for-form-not-facts) and [can be costly](https://www.glean.com/blog/how-to-build-an-ai-assistant-for-the-enterprise).\nRetrieval augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a popular and powerful mechanism to expand an LLM\'s knowledge base, using documents retrieved from an external data source to ground the LLM generation via in-context learning. \nThese notebooks accompany a [video playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfaIDFEXuae2LXbO1_PKyVJiQ23ZztA0x&feature=shared) that builds up an understanding of RAG from scratch, starting with the basics of indexing, retrieval, and generation. \n![rag_detail_v2](https://github.com/langchain-ai/rag-from-scratch/assets/122662504/54a2d76c-b07e-49e7-b4ce-fc45667360a1)\n \n',

Transcode and package your media for online streaming with simple API calls and sane defaults, or craft dynamic HLS playlists on the fly with bumpers, ads and filters.\n\n- Transcode your video file into separate quality tracks (eg; 1080p, 720p, 480p).\n- Write `HLS CMAF` playlists directly to S3, ready for playback!\n- Want to insert a bumper like Netflix? Stitch it as an HLS interstitial on the fly.\n- Insert linear ads as interstitials by providing a simple VMAP, or schedule VAST manually.\n- Use our player facade, a simplified API alongside [HLS.js](https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js), tailored for developers building a player UI.\n\nGive us a ‚≠ê if you like our work. Much appreciated!\n\n## Getting Started\n\n```shell\n# We have prebuilt containers, see docker/docker-compose.yml\ncd docker\n# Copy the example .env\ncp .env.example .env\n# Configure the .env\ndocker compose up -d\n```\n\nSelf-hosting can be challenging, but we aim to make hosting Superstreamer as easy as possible. Check out the [Getting Started](https://superstreamer.xyz/guide/getting-started.html) section for more information. It should get you started in minutes.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n<div align="center">\n  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/superstreamerapp/superstreamer/main/docs/public/dashboard-stitcher.png" target="_blank">\n    <img width="400" alt="Dashboard stitcher" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/superstreamerapp/superstreamer/main/docs/public/dashboard-stitcher.png" />\n  </a>\n  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/superstreamerapp/superstreamer/main/docs/public/dashboard-api.png" target="_blank">\n    <img width="400" alt="Dashboard stitcher" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/superstreamerapp/superstreamer/main/docs/public/dashboard-api.png" />\n  </a>\n  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/superstreamerapp/superstreamer/main/docs/public/dashboard-assets.png" target="_blank">\n    <img width="400" alt="Dashboard assets" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/superstreamerapp/superstreamer/main/docs/public/dashboard-assets.png" />\n  </a>\n  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/superstreamerapp/superstreamer/main/docs/public/dashboard-job.png" target="_blank">\n    <img width="400" alt="Dashboard job" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/superstreamerapp/superstreamer/main/docs/public/dashboard-job.png" />\n  </a>\n</div>\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe love our contributors!
